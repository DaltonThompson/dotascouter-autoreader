## Installation

1. Download the project.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Within the project, alter `config.json` as needed.
    Keys in `config.json`:
    - The `"logPath"` is a path to the server log file within the Dota game files. Home directory will be automatically added.
    - The integer `"patches"` indicates how many patches should be included in a player's history.
    - `"targetUrl"`: the URL to open, which will be followed by a query generated by this script
    - If `"fallback"` is set to `true` and the first line does not contain match data, it will attempt to read two more lines of the server log.
    - If `"devMode"` is set to `true`, it uses `"testLog"` (a path within the same directory) in place of `"logPath"`. This is only useful for testin
4. Run `npm start`. Use your usual keybinding to quit (e.g Ctrl-C for Mac).
